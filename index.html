                <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                <p>Kiran Mazumdar was born on 23 March 1953 in Bangalore, Karnataka state, to Gujarati parents. She was
                    educated at Bangalore's Bishop Cotton Girl's High School, graduating in 1968. She then attended
                    Mount Carmel College, Bangalore, a women's college offering pre-university courses as an affiliate
                    of Bangalore University. She studied biology and zoology, graduating from Bangalore University with
                    a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1973.Mazumdar hoped to go to medical school, but was not able to
                    obtain a scholarship.Her father, Rasendra Mazumdar, was the head brewmaster at United Breweries. He
                    suggested that she study fermentation science, and train to be a brewmaster, a very non-traditional
                    field for women. Mazumdar went to Ballarat College, Melbourne University in Australia to study
                    malting and brewing. In 1974, she was the only woman enrolled in the brewing course and topped in
                    her class. She earned the degree as master brewer in 1975.She worked as a trainee brewer in Carlton
                    and United Breweries, Melbourne and as a trainee maltster at Barrett Brothers and Burston,
                    Australia. She also worked for some time as a technical consultant at Jupiter Breweries Limited,
                    Calcutta and as a technical manager at Standard Maltings Corporation, Baroda between 1975 and 1977.
                    However, when she investigated the possibility of advancing her career in Bangalore or Delhi, she
                    was told that she could not be hired as a master brewer in India because "It's a man's work."She
                    began to look abroad for opportunities and was offered a position in Scotland.</p>
